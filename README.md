# justfixit.css
Whould it not be nice if you could just fix it?

Have you ever had the moment were you are looking at some html, thinking "I JUST WANT ..., BUT ...". adding it inline would work. but ..., Adding a new class and writing some css to the specific thing would be better but then I need to type more.

What it you could JUST FIX IT.
