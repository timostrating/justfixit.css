# justfixit.css
Whould it not be nice if you could just fix it?

Have you ever had the moment were you are looking at some html, thinking "I JUST WANT TO CHANGE THIS SMALL CSS THING, BUT ...". adding it inline would work. but .... Adding a new class and writing some css for that specific thing would be better but then I need to write more code.

What if you could JUST FIX IT.


## The idea

The idea of these files are to bring some of the most used css to the html code.
